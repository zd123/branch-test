## Grading / Point system
We are tracking the following metrics.
* Pre-Class HW, Regular HW, Attendance, and Class Participation.

Everything is worth 1 Point. There will be a scoreboard where you can track how you are doing.  _If you would like to opt out of the scoreboard, no problem, just let me and your TA know._


## Lecture
_Since we are setting up our github after lecture, you will not have the lecture files locally.  If you would like to code along, you can make a copy of this [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rujHx0nTq9HpkU50Lwyz2KI6uRzFIa0z?usp=sharing)._


## Getting started with notebooks. 

__Launching a juputer notebook.__

0. Open your terminal, navigate to whatever folder you want to work from. Then type into the terminal
0. `jupyter notebook` 
0. A browser window should pop up and you are now ready to ride.
0. _(extra credit, next class show class how to update their .bash_profile so they only have to type in 'jn' to launch jupyter notebook)_ 
0.  __If above does not work, follow instructions below__ 
	* First install jupyter notebook by running the following command
		* `pip install jupyter notebook`  
	* If that does not work, [follow instructions here](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)
	* If it still doesn't work, try using jupyter labs instead. 
		* `pip install jupyterlab`
	* If none of the above works, follow the setup instructions in the Setup folder in the main repo.
	* If it still does not work, ask for help in slack channel, or come to office hours. 



# Homework
__All HWs are due anytime before the next class__

#### Homework
* HW is the `Exercise-DONT-EDIT-MAKE-COPY.ipynb`
* Make a copy of that file.  Change the file name to be `Exercise-YOUR-INITIALS.ipynb`
* Make all your edits in that file and add, commit, and push that file to github. 
* Once you've posted that file to your github, paste the link to that notebook file (not your github repo, but your HW file itself) next to your name in your HW Submission sheet. 
* [Tuesday's HW Submission Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HJb_Hf0dVCOWhw-jimE-E9bnFCROZ1Hx_GLRlQhQ8lA/edit#gid=0)
* [Friday's 12:30 HW Submission Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JjyMHmS0n8IuCcYihp5Z9YtTDwsE2ygwIPUqT0tEowE/edit#gid=0)
* [Friday's 3:30 HW Submission Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PbQ1JI9cC9WZUnJoEgfoFWhXw7a5wx-53p7bmQmKhKI/edit#gid=0)

#### Pre class Homework for Week-2
* Watch this: [Intro to Viz with Pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=_hlMU8V6AvtFA6yV&t=311&v=a9UrKTVEeZA&feature=youtu.be).  (~15min)
* Do this:  [Plotting with Pandas](https://realpython.com/pandas-plot-python/) (~30min)
	* By doing this I mean, run the code they run and create (at least) all the plots they create. 
	* __WHEN COMPLETED reply in thread to the 'Week 2 Pre-Class work' slack message.__
	* Reply to the message with just one thing you learned, thought was cool, or found interesting _THAT HAS YET TO BE MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS REPLYS_. 
		* Replying to the message means hover over the message and click the ‘reply in thread’ message looking icon and type your response in there.  
		* Once you have replied, hover on your message, click the vertical '...' options thing. Then click, "Copy Link".  Now paste that link to your message next to your name in the HW Submission sheet (link above) in the Week-2-Prework column.
